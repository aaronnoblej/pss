# PSS (Personal Screen Share)
PSS (Personal Screen Share) is an application that allows users to connect and share their device screen with other devices via Bluetooth or LAN.
Users must have the PSS on their device, which will create a virtual screen that other users of PSS can send requests to share their screen to.

Eventually, I hope to add a feature that allows users to request control over the shared screen. Ultimately, the host will act as a server that can read inputs of other devices.

Some use cases of this software include:
* Gamers who wish to use multiple screens rather than having to crowd around one computer
* Presenters who do not have access to one large monitor, and can therefore broadcast to all devices on the local network
* Collaboration or presenting in area without access to Wi-Fi
* More!
